Analysts determined that multiple cyber threat actors, including an APT actor, were able to exploit a .NET deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2019-18935) in Progress Telerik user interface (UI) for ASP.NET AJAX, located in the agency’s Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for remote code execution. According to Progress Software, Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX builds before R1 2020 (2020.1.114) are vulnerable to this exploit.[1]\nActions to take today to mitigate malici…",

          "description": "In today’s blog post, Associate Director of the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) Clayton Romans highlighted recent successes of pre-ransomware notification and its impact in reducing harm from ransomware intrusions. With pre-ransomware notifications, organizations can receive early warning and potentially evict threat actors before they can encrypt and hold critical data and systems for ransom. Using this proactive cyber defense capability, CISA has notified more than 60 entities of early-stage ransomware intrusions since January 2023, including critical infrastructure organizations in the Energy, Healthcare and Public Health, Water and Wastewater Systems sectors, as well as the education community.\nThe pre-ransomware notification was cultivated with the help of the cybersecurity research community and through CISA’s relationships with infrastructure providers and cyber threat intelligence companies.\nFor more information, visit #StopRansomware. To report early-stage ransomware activity, visit Report Ransomware. CISA also encourages stakeholders and network defenders to review associate director Romans’ post, Getting Ahead of the Ransomware Epidemic: CISA’s Pre-Ransomware Notifications Help Organizations Stop Attacks Before Damage Occurs, to learn more about CISA’s Pre-Ransomware Notification Initiative.\nPlease share your thoughts.

          "description": "Today, the CISA, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), Threat Actors Exploit Progress Telerik Vulnerability in U.S. Government IIS Server. This joint CSA provides IT infrastructure defenders with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), indicators of compromise (IOCs), and methods to detect and protect against similar, successful CVE-2019-18935 exploitation.\nAs detailed in the advisory, CISA analysts determined that multiple cyber threat actors, including an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor, exploited a .NET deserialization vulnerability in Progress Telerik user interface for ASP.NET AJAX. Exploitation of this vulnerability allowed malicious actors to successfully execute remote code on a federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agency’s Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server. Actors were then able to upload malicious dynamic-link library (DLL) files (some masqueraded as portable network graphics [PNG] files) to the C:\\Windows\\Temp\\ directory. \nCISA, FBI, and MS-ISAC encourage network defenders to review the Detection and Mitigations sections of this advisory, as well as refer to the accompanying Malware Analysis Report, MAR-10413062-1.v1 Telerik Vulnerability in U.S. Government IIS Server, to reference CISA's analysis for the identified malicious files.\nPlease share your thoughts. We recently updated our anonymous Product Feedback Survey and we'd welcome your feedback.",
