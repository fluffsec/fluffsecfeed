CISA warns users to remain on alert for malicious cyber activity targeting potential disaster victims and charitable donors following a hurricane. Fraudulent emails—often containing malicious links or attachments—are common after major natural disasters. Exercise caution in handling emails with hurricane-related subject lines, attachments, or hyperlinks. In addition, be wary of social media pleas, texts, or door-to-door solicitations relating to severe weather events.
To avoid becoming victims of malicious activity, users and administrators should review the following resources and take preventative measures.
Staying Alert to Disaster-related Scams
Before Giving to a Charity
Staying Safe on Social Networking Sites
Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks
Using Caution with Email Attachments
If you believe you have been a victim of cybercrime, file a complaint with Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at www.ic3.gov.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: September 30, 2022
CISA has added three vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: September 29, 2022
CISA has published its Traffic Light Protocol 2.0 User Guide and Traffic Light Protocol: Moving to Version 2.0 fact sheet in preparation for its November 1, 2022 move from Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Version 1.0 to TLP 2.0.
Managed by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), TLP is a system of markings that communicates information sharing permissions. According to FIRST, the purpose of TLP is "to facilitate greater sharing of potentially sensitive information and more effective collaboration." Note: Unlike formal classification systems, TLP is not legally binding.
TLP Version 2.0 brings the following key updates:
TLP:CLEAR replaces TLP:WHITE for publicly releasable information.
TLP:AMBER+STRICT supplements TLP:AMBER, clarifying when information may be shared with the recipient’s organization only.
Note: CISA’s Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) capability will not update from TLP 1.0 to TLP 2.0 until March 2023. This exception includes AIS’s use of the following open standards: the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX™) for cyber threat indicators and defensive measures information and the Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII™) for machine-to-machine communications.
As CISA prepares to implement this update, we want to inform partners of the upcoming change and encourage all network defenders to adopt TLP Version 2.0 to facilitate greater information sharing and collaboration.
For more information on TLP, visit FIRST’s TLP webpage at www.first.org/tlp/. On November 1, 2022, CISA will update www.cisa.gov/tlp to reflect the TLP Version 2.0 changes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: September 23, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

Summary
Traditional approaches to securing OT/ICS do not adequately address current threats. 
Operational technology/industrial control system (OT/ICS) assets that operate, control, and monitor day-to-day critical infrastructure and industrial processes continue to be an attractive target for malicious cyber actors. These cyber actors, including advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, target OT/ICS assets to achieve political gains, economic advantages, or destructive effects. Because OT/ICS systems manage physical operational processes, cyber actors’ operations could result in physical consequences, including loss of life, property damage, and disruption of National Critical Functions.
OT/ICS devices and designs are publicly available, often inco…]]></summary>

CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), Iranian State Actors Conduct Cyber Operations Against the Government of Albania, detailing malicious cyber operations that included ransomware and disk wiper, rendering websites and services unavailable. The advisory indicates Iranian state cyber actors acquired initial access to the victim’s network approximately 14 months before launching the destructive cyber attack, periodically accessing and exfiltrating email content.
Joint CSA: Iranian State Actors Conduct Cyber Operations Against the Government of Albania outlines tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) likely used by Iranian state cyber actors as recently as July 2022. CISA and FBI encourage users and administrators to review the advisory and apply the recommended mitigations to limit the risk of compromise. For additional information on Iranian cyber threats, see CISA’s Iran Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage.

CISA has added six new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.  
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA and the National Security Agency (NSA) have published Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations. This product—generated by the Enduring Security Framework (ESF) Open Radio Access Network (RAN) Working Panel, a subgroup within the cross-sector working group— assessed the benefits and security considerations associated with implementing an Open RAN architecture. Focusing on current designs and specification standards, the ESF Open RAN Working Panel examined how security compares with, and is distinct from, traditional, proprietary RANs.
CISA encourages users, network operators, vendors, and stakeholders to review the considerations. For more information, see the ESF’s Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations, peruse CISA’s 5G Library, and visit Securing 5G Open RAN Architecture from Cybersecurity Risks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: September 14, 2022
CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the “Date Added to Catalog” column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), U.S. Cyber Command (USCC) - Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF), Department of the Treasury, Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), and United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Affiliated Cyber Actors Exploiting Vulnerabilities for Data Extortion and Disk Encryption for Ransom Operations. This advisory updates previous joint reporting from November 2021, to highlight continued malicious cyber activity by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors that the authoring agencies now assess are associated with the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
The authoring agencies urge network defenders to examine their current cybersecurity posture and apply the recommended mitigations in this joint CSA, which include:
Patch all systems and prioritize remediating known exploited vulnerabilities.
Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA).
Secure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and other risky services.
Make offline backups of your data.
See Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Affiliated Cyber Actors Exploiting Vulnerabilities for Data Extortion and Disk Encryption for Ransom Operations and joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities for information on these Iranian government-sponsored APT actors’ tactics and techniques, indicators of compromise, and recommended mitigations. Additionally, review StopRansomware.gov for more guidance on ransomware protection, detection, and response.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: September 8, 2022
CISA has added twelve new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.
