          "description": "Jaewon Min of Cisco Talos discovered these vulnerabilities. Blog by Jon Munshaw. \nUpdate (Aug. 3, 2022): Talos disclosed two new vulnerabilities in the Alyac antivirus software and added their details to this post.\nCisco Talos recently discovered out-of-bounds read and buffer overflow vulnerabilities in ESTsecurity Corp.’s Alyac antivirus software that could cause a denial-of-service condition or arbitrary code execution. Alyac is an antivirus software developed for Microsoft Windows machines. \nTALOS-2022-1452 (CVE-2022-21147) is a vulnerability that exists in a specific Alyac module that, eventually, leads to a crash of Alyac’s scanning process, which effectively neutralizes the antivirus scan. If successful, an attacker could trigger this vulnerability to stop the program from scanning for malware, which would be crucial in a potential attack scenario. \nTALOS-2022-1527 (CVE-2022-32543) and TALOS-2022-1533 (CVE-2022-29886) are heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine. The adversary would have to convince a user to open a specially crafted OLE file to trigger this condition.\n\nCisco Talos worked with ESTsecurity to ensure that these issues are resolved and an update is available for affected customers, all in adherence to Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy. \n\n\nUsers are encouraged to update these affected products as soon as possible: ESTsoft Alyac, versions 2.5.7.7 and 2.5.8.544. Talos tested and confirmed ESTsoft Alyac, version 2.5.7.7, is affected by TALOS-2022-1452. Version 2.5.8.544 is vulnerable to TALOS-2022-1533 and TALOS-2022-1527.\n\n\nThe following Snort rules will detect exploitation attempts against these vulnerabilities: 59014, 59015, and 60035 - 60042. Additional rules may be released in the future and current rules are subject to change, pending additional vulnerability information. For the most current rule information, please refer to your Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center or Snort.org.",

          "description": "By Carl Hurd. \nThe TCL LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi system is a multi-device Wi-Fi system that allows users to expand access to their network over a large physical area. What makes the LInkHub system unique is the lack of a network interface to manage the devices individually or in the mesh. Instead, a phone application is the only method to interact with these devices. This is noteworthy because, in theory, it significantly reduces the common attack surface on most small office/home office (SOHO) routers, as it moves the entire HTTP/S code base from the product. This means, in theory, fewer issues with integration or hacked-together scripts to trigger various functions within the device. One of the issues with this approach though is that its functionality still needs to reside somewhere for the us…",

          "description": "By Francesco Benvenuto. \nRecently, I was performing some research on a wireless router and noticed the following piece of code: \n\nThis unescape function will revert the URL encoded bytes to its original form. But something specifically caught my attention: There was no size check for the performed operations and the function assumes that after a ‘%’ there are always two bytes. So, what would happen if after ‘%’, only one character existed? The answer is that the s+3, in the strcpy, will access after the end of the string. So, it could lead to memory corruption. \nThen, I tried to exploit this bug on the router in question. But based on how the URL string was managed in that device, it was not possible. But it had the potential to crash other web servers that used this piece of code. That fu…",

          "description": "Emmanuel Tacheau of Cisco Talos discovered these vulnerabilities. Blog by Jon Munshaw. \nCisco Talos recently discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in Accusoft ImageGear's PSD header processing function. \nThe ImageGear library is a document-imaging developer toolkit that allows users to create, edit, annotate and convert various images. It supports more than 100 file formats such as DICOM, PDF and Microsoft Office. \nThis vulnerability, TALOS-2022-1526 (CVE-2022-29465) could allow an attacker to cause a use-after-free condition by tricking the targeted user into opening a malformed .psd file in the application. The vulnerability leads to out-of-bounds heap writes, which causes memory corruption and, possibly, code execution. \nIn adherence to Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy, Accusoft patched this issue and released an update for ImageGear.\n\nTalos tested and confirmed Accusoft ImageGear, version 19.10, is affected by this vulnerability. \n\n\nThe following Snort rules will detect exploitation attempts against this vulnerability: 60228 and 60229. Additional rules may be released in the future and current rules are subject to change, pending additional vulnerability information. For the most current rule information, please refer to your Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center or Snort.org.",
