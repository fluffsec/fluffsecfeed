        <link href="https://blog.talosintelligence.com/2022/08/vuln-spotlight-hdf5-library.html"/>
        <updated>2022-08-16T14:03:00.002Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dave McDaniel of Cisco Talos discovered these vulnerabilities. Blog by Jon Munshaw. 
Cisco Talos recently discovered three vulnerabilities in a library that works with the HDF5 file format that could allow an attacker to execute remote code on a targeted device. 
These issues arise in the libhdf5 gif2h5 tool that’s normally used to convert a GIF file to the HDF5 format, commonly used to store large amounts of numerical data. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted, malicious file. 
TALOS-2022-1485 (CVE-2022-25972) and TALOS-2022-1486 (CVE-2022-25942) are out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities in the gif2h5 tool that trigger a specific crash, opening the door for code execution from the adversary. TALOS-2022-1487 (CVE-2022-26061) works similarly but is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability. 

Cisco Talos is disclosing these vulnerabilities despite no official fix from HDF5 in adherence to the 90-day deadline outlined in Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy. 


Users are encouraged to update these affected products as soon as possible: HDF5 Group libhdf5, version 1.10.4. Talos tested and confirmed these versions of the library could be exploited by these vulnerabilities. 
The following Snort rules will detect exploitation attempts against this vulnerability: 59296, 59297, 59300, 59301, 59303 and 59304. Additional rules may be released in the future and current rules are subject to change, pending additional vulnerability information. For the most current rule information, please refer to your Firepower Management Center or Snort.org.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: August 11, 2022
CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information. 
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

This batch of updates also includes a fix for a new vulnerability in the Microsoft Windows Support Diagnostic Tool (MSDT) that’s actively being exploited in the wild, according to Microsoft. MSDT was already the target of the so-called “Follina” zero-day vulnerability in June.  
In all, August’s Patch Tuesday includes 15 critical vulnerabilities and a single low- and moderate-severity issue. The remainder is classified as “important.”

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: August 9, 2022
CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.    
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.    
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: August 4, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Jaewon Min of Cisco Talos discovered these vulnerabilities. Blog by Jon Munshaw. 
Update (Aug. 3, 2022): Talos disclosed two new vulnerabilities in the Alyac antivirus software and added their details to this post.
Cisco Talos recently discovered out-of-bounds read and buffer overflow vulnerabilities in ESTsecurity Corp.’s Alyac antivirus software that could cause a denial-of-service condition or arbitrary code execution. Alyac is an antivirus software developed for Microsoft Windows machines. 
TALOS-2022-1452 (CVE-2022-21147) is a vulnerability that exists in a specific Alyac module that, eventually, leads to a crash of Alyac’s scanning process, which effectively neutralizes the antivirus scan. If successful, an attacker could trigger this vulnerability to stop the program from scanning for malware, which would be crucial in a potential attack scenario. 
TALOS-2022-1527 (CVE-2022-32543) and TALOS-2022-1533 (CVE-2022-29886) are heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine. The adversary would have to convince a user to open a specially crafted OLE file to trigger this condition.

Cisco Talos worked with ESTsecurity to ensure that these issues are resolved and an update is available for affected customers, all in adherence to Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy. 


Users are encouraged to update these affected products as soon as possible: ESTsoft Alyac, versions 2.5.7.7 and 2.5.8.544. Talos tested and confirmed ESTsoft Alyac, version 2.5.7.7, is affected by TALOS-2022-1452. Version 2.5.8.544 is vulnerable to TALOS-2022-1533 and TALOS-2022-1527.


The following Snort rules will detect exploitation attempts against these vulnerabilities: 59014, 59015, and 60035 - 60042. Additional rules may be released in the future and current rules are subject to change, pending additional vulnerability information. For the most current rule information, please refer to your Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center or Snort.org.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: August 2, 2022 | Last revised: August 4, 2022
CISA and the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) have published a joint Cybersecurity Advisory on the top malware strains observed in 2021. Malicious cyber actors often use malware to covertly compromise and then gain access to a computer or mobile device. As malicious cyber actors have been using most of these top malware strains for more than five years, organizations have opportunities to better prepare, identify, and mitigate attacks from these strains.  
CISA and ACSC encourage organizations to apply the recommendations in the Mitigations sections of the joint CSA. These mitigations include prioritizing patching all systems with known exploited vulnerabilities, enforcing multifactor authentication (MFA), securing remote desktop protocol (RDP) and other risky services, making offline backups of your data, and providing end-user awareness and training about social engineering and phishing. The appendix contains detection signatures organizations can employ in defending their networks. For more information on preventing malicious cyber actors from using 2021 top malware strains to exploit vulnerabilities, see:
•    CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog 
CISA’s Cyber Hygiene Services
CISA’s Choosing and Protecting Passwords
ACSC’s Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[By Carl Hurd. 
The TCL LinkHub Mesh Wi-Fi system is a multi-device Wi-Fi system that allows users to expand access to their network over a large physical area. What makes the LInkHub system unique is the lack of a network interface to manage the devices individually or in the mesh. Instead, a phone application is the only method to interact with these devices. This is noteworthy because, in theory, it significantly reduces the common attack surface on most small office/home office (SOHO) routers, as it moves the entire HTTP/S code base from the product. This means, in theory, fewer issues with integration or hacked-together scripts to trigger various functions within the device. One of the issues with this approach though is that its functionality still needs to reside somewhere for the us…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: July 29, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA encourages users and administrators to review U.S. Cyber Command’s press release, Cyber National Mission Force discloses IOCs from Ukrainian networks, as well as their VirusTotal and GitHub pages for more information. See Mandiant’s report, Evacuation and Humanitarian Documents used to Spear Phish Ukrainian Entities, for additional information.

CISA has released an Industrial Controls Systems Advisory (ICSA) detailing six vulnerabilities that were discovered in MiCODUS MV720 Global Positioning System Tracker. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote actor to exploit access and gain control the global positioning system tracker. These vulnerabilities could impact access to a vehicle fuel supply, vehicle control, or allow locational surveillance of vehicles in which the device is installed.
CISA encourages users and technicians to review ICS Advisory ICSA-22-200-01: MiCODUS MV720 GPS Tracker for technical details and mitigations and the Bitsight Report: Critical Vulnerabilities in Widely Used Vehicle GPS Tracker for additional information.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emmanuel Tacheau of Cisco Talos discovered these vulnerabilities. Blog by Jon Munshaw. 
Cisco Talos recently discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in Accusoft ImageGear's PSD header processing function. 
The ImageGear library is a document-imaging developer toolkit that allows users to create, edit, annotate and convert various images. It supports more than 100 file formats such as DICOM, PDF and Microsoft Office. 
This vulnerability, TALOS-2022-1526 (CVE-2022-29465) could allow an attacker to cause a use-after-free condition by tricking the targeted user into opening a malformed .psd file in the application. The vulnerability leads to out-of-bounds heap writes, which causes memory corruption and, possibly, code execution. 
In adherence to Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy, Accusoft patched this issue and released an update for ImageGear.

Talos tested and confirmed Accusoft ImageGear, version 19.10, is affected by this vulnerability. 


The following Snort rules will detect exploitation attempts against this vulnerability: 60228 and 60229. Additional rules may be released in the future and current rules are subject to change, pending additional vulnerability information. For the most current rule information, please refer to your Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center or Snort.org.]]></summary>
