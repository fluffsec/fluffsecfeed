        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2022-27926 Zimbra Collaboration (ZCS) Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.
Please share your thoughts. We recently updated our anonymous Product Feedback Survey and we'd welcome your feedback.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added ten new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2013-3163 Microsoft Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability
CVE-2014-1776 Microsoft Internet Explorer Memory Corruption Vulnerability
CVE-2017-7494 Samba Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
CVE-2022-42948 Fortra Cobalt Strike User Interface Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

CVE-2022-3038 Google Chrome Use-After-Free Vulnerability
CVE-2022-22706 Arm Mali GPU Kernel Driver Unspecified Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice.

The Untitled Goose Tool offers novel authentication and data gathering methods for network defenders to use as they interrogate and analyze their Microsoft cloud services. The tool enables users to:
Export and review AAD sign-in and audit logs, M365 unified audit log (UAL), Azure activity logs, Microsoft Defender for IoT (internet of things) alerts, and Microsoft Defender for Endpoint (MDE) data for suspicious activity.
Query, export, and investigate AAD, M365, and Azure configurations.
Extract cloud artifacts from Microsoft’s AAD, Azure, and M365 environments without performing additional analytics. 
Perform time bounding of the UAL.
Extract data within those time bounds. 
Collect and review data using similar time bounding capabilities for MDE data.
Untitled Goose Tool was developed by CISA with support from Sandia National Laboratories. Network defenders can see the Untitled Goose Tool fact sheet and visit the Untitled Goose Tool GitHub repository to get started.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In today’s blog post, Associate Director of the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) Clayton Romans highlighted recent successes of pre-ransomware notification and its impact in reducing harm from ransomware intrusions. With pre-ransomware notifications, organizations can receive early warning and potentially evict threat actors before they can encrypt and hold critical data and systems for ransom. Using this proactive cyber defense capability, CISA has notified more than 60 entities of early-stage ransomware intrusions since January 2023, including critical infrastructure organizations in the Energy, Healthcare and Public Health, Water and Wastewater Systems sectors, as well as the education community.
The pre-ransomware notification was cultivated with the help of the cybersecurity research community and through CISA’s relationships with infrastructure providers and cyber threat intelligence companies.
For more information, visit #StopRansomware. To report early-stage ransomware activity, visit Report Ransomware. CISA also encourages stakeholders and network defenders to review associate director Romans’ post, Getting Ahead of the Ransomware Epidemic: CISA’s Pre-Ransomware Notifications Help Organizations Stop Attacks Before Damage Occurs, to learn more about CISA’s Pre-Ransomware Notification Initiative.

[Heads Up] This Week's New SVB Meltdown Social Engineering Attacks
 
  
On Saturday March 11, I warned about the coming wave of phishing attacks that would undoubtedly follow the SVB collapse. We were not disappointed.
 
  
There is a raft of new registered domains that are SVB-related, for example login.svb[.]com and many others that will probably all be used for business email compromise (BEC) attacks.
 
  
Adi Ikan, CEO of Veriti, observed that "Phishing campaigns are leveraging SVB's recent collapse to impersonate the bank and its online services. We have observed an increase in the registration of fake phishing domains in the U.S. (88%), Spain (7%), France (3%) and Israel (2%), and we anticipate this number to gro…]]></summary>

IAM—a framework of business processes, policies, and technologies that facilitate the management of digital identities—ensures that users only gain access to data when they have the appropriate credentials. This paper provides recommended best practices and mitigations to counter threats to IAM related to:
identity governance
environmental hardening

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In light of recent bank failures, CISA warns consumers to beware of potential scams requesting your money or sensitive personal information. Exercise caution in handling emails with bank-related subject lines, attachments, or links. In addition, be wary of social media pleas, texts, or door-to-door solicitations relating to any failed bank.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the "Receiver" of failed banks, would never contact you asking for personal details, such as bank account information, credit and debit card numbers, social security numbers, or passwords.
To avoid becoming victims of scams, consumers should review the following resources and take preventative measures:
CISA: Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks
FDIC Consumer News: Beware, It’s a Scam!
FDIC Consumer News: Scammers Pretending to be the FDIC
FDIC: Failed Bank Information for Silicon Valley Bank, Santa Clara, CA
FDIC: Failed Bank Information for Signature Bank, New York, NY
CISA: Phishing Infographic 
Consider reporting scams and fraud to the police and file a report with the Federal Trade Commission.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2023-26360 Adobe ColdFusion Improper Access Control Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, the CISA, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), Threat Actors Exploit Progress Telerik Vulnerability in U.S. Government IIS Server. This joint CSA provides IT infrastructure defenders with tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), indicators of compromise (IOCs), and methods to detect and protect against similar, successful CVE-2019-18935 exploitation.
As detailed in the advisory, CISA analysts determined that multiple cyber threat actors, including an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actor, exploited a .NET deserialization vulnerability in Progress Telerik user interface for ASP.NET AJAX. Exploitation of this vulnerability allowed malicious actors to successfully execute remote code on a federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agency’s Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server. Actors were then able to upload malicious dynamic-link library (DLL) files (some masqueraded as portable network graphics [PNG] files) to the C:\Windows\Temp\ directory. 
CISA, FBI, and MS-ISAC encourage network defenders to review the Detection and Mitigations sections of this advisory, as well as refer to the accompanying Malware Analysis Report, MAR-10413062-1.v1 Telerik Vulnerability in U.S. Government IIS Server, to reference CISA's analysis for the identified malicious files.

        <updated>2023-03-14T19:20:49.838Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added three new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2023-23397 Microsoft Office Outlook Spoofing Vulnerability
CVE-2023-24880 Microsoft Windows SmartScreen Security Feature Bypass Vulnerability
CVE-2022-41328 Fortinet FortiOS Path Traversal Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.

[Heads Up] Employees Are Feeding Sensitive Biz Data to ChatGPT, Raising Security Fears
 
  
Robert Lemos at DARKReading just reported on a worrying trend. The title said it all, and the news is that more than 4% of employees have put sensitive corporate data into the large language model, raising concerns that its popularity may result in massive leaks of proprietary information.

From November 2022 through early January 2023, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and authoring organizations identified the presence of indicators of compromise (IOCs) at a federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agency. Analysts determined that multiple cyber threat actors, including an APT actor, were able to exploit a .NET deserialization vulnerability (CVE-2019-18935) in Progress Telerik user interface (UI) for ASP.NET AJAX, located in the agency’s Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) web server. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for remote code execution. According to Progress Software, Telerik UI for ASP.NET AJAX builds before R1 2020 (2020.1.114) are vulnerable to this exploit.[1]

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2020-5741 Plex Media Server Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
CVE-2021-39144 XStream Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.
Please share your thoughts. We recently updated our anonymous Product Feedback Survey and we'd welcome your feedback.]]></summary>
