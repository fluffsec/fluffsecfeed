        <updated>2022-07-29T15:57:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: July 29, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA has released an Industrial Controls Systems Advisory (ICSA) detailing six vulnerabilities that were discovered in MiCODUS MV720 Global Positioning System Tracker. Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities may allow a remote actor to exploit access and gain control the global positioning system tracker. These vulnerabilities could impact access to a vehicle fuel supply, vehicle control, or allow locational surveillance of vehicles in which the device is installed.
CISA encourages users and technicians to review ICS Advisory ICSA-22-200-01: MiCODUS MV720 GPS Tracker for technical details and mitigations and the Bitsight Report: Critical Vulnerabilities in Widely Used Vehicle GPS Tracker for additional information.

        <updated>2022-07-19T12:45:00.005Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Emmanuel Tacheau of Cisco Talos discovered these vulnerabilities. Blog by Jon Munshaw. 
Cisco Talos recently discovered a use-after-free vulnerability in Accusoft ImageGear's PSD header processing function. 
The ImageGear library is a document-imaging developer toolkit that allows users to create, edit, annotate and convert various images. It supports more than 100 file formats such as DICOM, PDF and Microsoft Office. 
This vulnerability, TALOS-2022-1526 (CVE-2022-29465) could allow an attacker to cause a use-after-free condition by tricking the targeted user into opening a malformed .psd file in the application. The vulnerability leads to out-of-bounds heap writes, which causes memory corruption and, possibly, code execution. 
In adherence to Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy, Accusoft patched this issue and released an update for ImageGear.

Talos tested and confirmed Accusoft ImageGear, version 19.10, is affected by this vulnerability. 


The following Snort rules will detect exploitation attempts against this vulnerability: 60228 and 60229. Additional rules may be released in the future and current rules are subject to change, pending additional vulnerability information. For the most current rule information, please refer to your Cisco Secure Firewall Management Center or Snort.org.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Piotr Bania of Cisco Talos discovered this vulnerability. Blog by Jon Munshaw. 
Cisco Talos recently discovered an exploitable use-after-free vulnerability in Google Chrome’s WebGPU standard.  
Google Chrome is a cross-platform web browser — and Chromium is the open-source version of the browser that both Google and other software developers use as the basis to build their browsers, as well. This specific vulnerability exists in WebGPU, which is a JavaScript API for processing accelerated 3-D graphics and other functions in the browser. 
TALOS-2022-1508 (CVE-2022-2399) occurs if the user opens a specially crafted web page in Chrome. That page could trigger a use-after-free condition in the application, which an attacker could then use to manipulate the browser in additional ways.  

Cisco Talos worked with Google to ensure that this issue is resolved and an update is available for affected customers, all in adherence to Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy. 
Users are encouraged to update these affected products as soon as possible: Google Chrome, version 102.0.4956.0 (64-bit) and 99.0.4844.82 (64-bit). Talos tested and confirmed these versions of Chrome could be exploited by this vulnerability. 


The following Snort rules will detect exploitation attempts against this vulnerability: 59448 and 59449. Additional rules may be released in the future and current rules are subject to change, pending additional vulnerability information. For the most current rule information, please refer to your Firepower Management Center or Snort.org.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Aleksandar Nikolic of Cisco Talos discovered these vulnerabilities. Blog by Jon Munshaw. 
Cisco Talos recently discovered two use-after-free vulnerabilities in Adobe Acrobat Reader DC that could allow an attacker to eventually gain the ability to execute arbitrary code.  
Acrobat is one of the most popular PDF reader software options available currently. It includes the ability to read and process JavaScript to give PDFs greater interactivity and customization options for users. This vulnerability exists in the way Acrobat Reader processes JavaScript.  

TALOS-2022-1516 (CVE-2022-34221) is a type confusion vulnerability that is triggered if the user opens a PDF with specially crafted, malicious JavaScript embedded. Object misuse can cause memory corruption, which can lead to arbitrary code execution. TALOS-2022-1525 (CVE-2022-34230) can trigger the reuse of a freed object, which can ultimately result in arbitrary code execution, as well.

Cisco Talos worked with Adobe to ensure that these issues are resolved and an update is available for affected customers, all in adherence to Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy. 


Users are advised to update the following software, which is tested and confirmed to be affected by these vulnerabilities: Adobe Acrobat Reader, version 2022.001.20085.  


The following Snort rules will detect exploitation attempts against this vulnerability: 59644, 59645, 59942 and 59943. Additional rules may be released in the future and current rules are subject to change, pending additional vulnerability information. For the most current rule information, please refer to your Cisco Secure Firewall management center or Snort.org.]]></summary>
