It is often unspoken, based on behaviours, hidden in the thoughts and minds of people. We often see it embedded in the organisation’s framework: in its vision, mission and values, which can also describe the attitudes it has towards various things. Such as, does it value innovation over tradition? Does it focus on people or processes? Does it embrace change? Or, will it fight it every step of the way?",

A recent report from software firm GlobalScape found that organizations lose an average of $4 million in revenue due to just one non-compliance event. Yikes! \n \r\nIn our 2022 State of Employee Compliance Training report, we compiled the top challenges faced by compliance training managers. Nearly half of survey respondents ranked completion percentage and employee engagement as their #1 challenge. Following closely behind was the need to stay current with local and/or industry regulations. Other roadblocks to a successful program include limited resources, unengaging content, cost, getting executive support, and reporting.\n \r\nKnowBe4’s SVP of Learning Innovation, John Just, spearheads the training content strategy and development for KnowBe4.
