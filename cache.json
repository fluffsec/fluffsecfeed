As malicious cyber actors have been using most of these top malware strains for more than five years, organizations have opportunities to better prepare, identify, and mitigate attacks from these strains.  \nCISA and ACSC encourage organizations to apply the recommendations in the Mitigations sections of the joint CSA. These mitigations include prioritizing patching all systems with known exploited vulnerabilities, enforcing multifactor authentication (MFA), securing remote desktop protocol (RDP) and other risky services, making offline backups of your data, and providing end-user awareness and training about social engineering and phishing. The appendix contains detection signatures organizations can employ in defending their networks.

Blog by Jon Munshaw. \nCisco Talos recently discovered three vulnerabilities in a library that works with the HDF5 file format that could allow an attacker to execute remote code on a targeted device. \nThese issues arise in the libhdf5 gif2h5 tool that’s normally used to convert a GIF file to the HDF5 format, commonly used to store large amounts of numerical data. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by tricking a user into opening a specially crafted, malicious file. \nTALOS-2022-1485 (CVE-2022-25972) and TALOS-2022-1486 (CVE-2022-25942) are out-of-bounds write vulnerabilities in the gif2h5 tool that trigger a specific crash, opening the door for code execution from the adversary. TALOS-2022-1487 (CVE-2022-26061) works similarly but is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability. \n\nCisco Talos is disclosing these vulnerabilities despite no official fix from HDF5 in adherence to the 90-day deadline outlined in Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy. \n\n\nUsers are encouraged to update these affected products as soon as possible: HDF5 Group libhdf5, version 1.10.4. Talos tested and confirmed these versions of the library could be exploited by these vulnerabilities. \nThe following Snort rules will detect exploitation attempts against this vulnerability: 59296, 59297, 59300, 59301, 59303 and 59304. Additional rules may be released in the future and current rules are subject to change, pending additional vulnerability information.

Blog by Jon Munshaw. \nUpdate (Aug. 3, 2022): Talos disclosed two new vulnerabilities in the Alyac antivirus software and added their details to this post.\nCisco Talos recently discovered out-of-bounds read and buffer overflow vulnerabilities in ESTsecurity Corp.’s Alyac antivirus software that could cause a denial-of-service condition or arbitrary code execution. Alyac is an antivirus software developed for Microsoft Windows machines. \nTALOS-2022-1452 (CVE-2022-21147) is a vulnerability that exists in a specific Alyac module that, eventually, leads to a crash of Alyac’s scanning process, which effectively neutralizes the antivirus scan. If successful, an attacker could trigger this vulnerability to stop the program from scanning for malware, which would be crucial in a potential attack scenario. \nTALOS-2022-1527 (CVE-2022-32543) and TALOS-2022-1533 (CVE-2022-29886) are heap-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit to execute arbitrary code on the targeted machine. The adversary would have to convince a user to open a specially crafted OLE file to trigger this condition.\n\nCisco Talos worked with ESTsecurity to ensure that these issues are resolved and an update is available for affected customers, all in adherence to Cisco’s vulnerability disclosure policy. \n\n\nUsers are encouraged to update these affected products as soon as possible: ESTsoft Alyac, versions 2.5.7.7 and 2.5.8.544. Talos tested and confirmed ESTsoft Alyac, version 2.5.7.7, is affected by TALOS-2022-1452. Version 2.5.8.544 is vulnerable to TALOS-2022-1533 and TALOS-2022-1527.\n\n\nThe following Snort rules will detect exploitation attempts against these vulnerabilities: 59014, 59015, and 60035 - 60042. Additional rules may be released in the future and current rules are subject to change, pending additional vulnerability information.

What makes the LInkHub system unique is the lack of a network interface to manage the devices individually or in the mesh. Instead, a phone application is the only method to interact with these devices. This is noteworthy because, in theory, it significantly reduces the common attack surface on most small office/home office (SOHO) routers, as it moves the entire HTTP/S code base from the product. This means, in theory, fewer issues with integration or hacked-together scripts to trigger various functions within the device.
