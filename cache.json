Additionally, the blog details advances—including\nCISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) machine-readable security advisories, and the Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX)—that, used in conjunction with SSVC, will reduce the window cyber threat actors have to exploit networks.\nCISA encourages organizations to read EAD Goldstein's blog post and to use the following resources on the SSVC webpage to strengthen their vulnerability management processes:\nCISA's SSVC decision tree\nSSVC Guide on using SSVC and the SSVC decision tree\nSSVC Calculator for prioritizing vulnerability responses in an organization’s respective environment\nThis product is provided subject to this Notification and this Privacy & Use policy.",

People arrived at the shops the night before waiting in line for the doors to open. Then, in 2005 the clever people at the National Retail Federation decided that an online frenzy of shopping was needed the Monday after Thanksgiving. We know this Monday as Cyber Monday. In 2008, Cyber Monday hit the big time as Thanksgiving fell five days later than in 2007 so the people were hungry for the online deals. The anticipation of the online deals created a frenzy and launched Cyber Monday into the stratosphere. Over time, Black Friday became Black November as retailers cashed in on the sales and consumers obliged.",
