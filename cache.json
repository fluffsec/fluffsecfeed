A recent report from software firm GlobalScape found that organizations lose an average of $4 million in revenue due to just one non-compliance event. Yikes! \n \r\nIn our 2022 State of Employee Compliance Training report, we compiled the top challenges faced by compliance training managers. Nearly half of survey respondents ranked completion percentage and employee engagement as their #1 challenge. Following closely behind was the need to stay current with local and/or industry regulations. Other roadblocks to a successful program include limited resources, unengaging content, cost, getting executive support, and reporting.\n \r\nKnowBe4’s SVP of Learning Innovation, John Just, spearheads the training content strategy and development for KnowBe4. Based on his years of experience in the learning and training industry, we asked for his top 10 tips to run a successful compliance training program in your organization.
